# TheApp
This is a self-study and an excercise in REST-ful API's, Authentification and Angular.

The plan for the project is to create a common planning tool for me and my roommates so we can see when who is home, whose turn it is to clean, and what plans there are for the common areas.

To do this i want the HTTP server to run on Nginx on a Ubuntu Server distro on a raspberry PI connected to our wireless.

I'm adding Authentification to the API because i dont want it to be accessible from outside, and for the sake of the excercise.
